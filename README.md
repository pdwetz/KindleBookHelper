KindleBookHelper
================

Converts raw text file to html format that can be consumed by KindleGen.

Very basic and only really works for poetry at the moment. It assumes the first line is the name of the poem
and that each stanza is separated by a line break. Likewise, each poem is separated by "[END]" text.

It will generate navigation, including linkable table of contents.
